-## Goal
-This package aims to make analysis and experimentation of generative AI/ML models broadly accessible, by providing a simple and consistent interface to foundation models, and abstract methods to support some of the common use-cases. This includes using smaller, less compute heavy Open Source language models to support the various NLP-based Data Science workflows in the industry. Additionally, we want to empower Data Science projects with the tools to easily productionise custom-built generative models.

-### Roadmap
-
-Model development and analysis
-- Support for additional open source and commercial language model
-- Model evaluation methods (including adversarial evaluation)
-- Prompt engineering support and analysis (adding further methods and adding support for more LLMs)
-- Parameter-efficient fine tuning (e.g. LoRA, prompt tuning etc)
-- Model intepretability methods
-- Model emergent effect simulation and analysis (related to long term AI safety risks)
-
-Model productionisation
-- Automated refactoring of experimental code into source code

-## Goal
-This package aims to make analysis and experimentation of generative AI/ML models broadly accessible, by providing a simple and consistent interface to foundation models, and abstract methods to support some of the common use-cases. This includes using smaller, less compute heavy Open Source language models to support the various NLP-based Data Science workflows in the industry. Additionally, we want to empower Data Science projects with the tools to easily productionise custom-built generative models.

-We are passionate about AI technology and AI safety, and this supports our contribution towards a beneficial outcome in an AI-powered world. Please note this is a work in progress, so very much open for collaboration and contribution. 
+A library with simple to use abstractions when working with LLMs inspired by the sckit-learn style API. <br>
+üîç Easily explore and experiment with commercial and open source LLMs, including ones that can be run on your local machine. <br>
+‚ö° Easily integrate language models of different sizes, including smaller, less compute heavy but still very useful LLMs in NLP-based Data Science contexts. <br>
+üöÄ Support the development of LLM workflows with off-the-shelf or custom-built generative models. <br><br>
+Please note this is a work in progress, and it's open for collabration and contribution.

-### Roadmap
-
-Model development and analysis
-- Support for additional open source and commercial language model
-- Model evaluation methods (including adversarial evaluation)
-- Prompt engineering support and analysis (adding further methods and adding support for more LLMs)
-- Parameter-efficient fine tuning (e.g. LoRA, prompt tuning etc)
-- Model intepretability methods
-- Model emergent effect simulation and analysis (related to long term AI safety risks)
-
-Model productionisation
-- Automated refactoring of experimental code into source code
-- Automated API wrapper generation
-- Automated dockerization
-
 ### Support
 
 You can support us by contributing to this project, as well as providing feedback and ideas in the [issues](https://github.com/Pan-ML/panml/issues) section. 
 
 We would also appreciate if you can give panml a ‚≠ê on GitHub, and if it adds value to you, sharing this with others in your network on LinkedIn/Twitter/Medium etc who would also find this useful.
